<h1 align="center" style="color:#FF26D0">About Us</h1>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">Who are you?</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">
We are the Negative Disc Researchers. We research prototype discs of the lost game named "Petscop".<br>
This site was once part of the Petscop Discovery Pages but these "negative discs" do not apply to the rules of the timeline.<br>
The site was originally made by Colon, as he is the first negative disc researcher. Ownership was later passed to us and Colon disappeared mysteriously.

<br><br>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">What is this site?</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">This site is a site listing everything we know and isn't private information about the negative discs. We started it in 2007.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">What is Petscop?</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">We suggest to research the topic yourself. We do not research the main discs of the game "Petscop"</p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">What are the negative discs?</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">The negative discs are every prototype copy of the game "Petscop". We first learned about them when researching the game's developer "Garalina"<br>
There are many prototype copies of the game which is why we moved from the Petscop Discovery Organization to our own.</p>
