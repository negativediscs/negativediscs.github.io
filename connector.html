<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">What is The Connector?</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">
The Connector is a creature that has been spotted in every neagtive disc except Disc 0.<br>
It has been in every one of them in one way or another.<br>
The most common way it would appear is in the body of a player character in the "Communication Room"<br>

Little is known about The Connector. It seems to be an AI programmed by presumably Rainer.<br>
It doesn't seem to resemble anybody from the timeline.

<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">The Communication Room</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">The "Communication Room" was first found in Disc -2.<br>
The same room also later appeared in Disc -1, as shown by the disc searcher's screenshots.<br>
The room contains a note written by an unknown person, as the disc searcher cut out the name from their screenshots.
