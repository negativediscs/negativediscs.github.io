<h1 align="center" style="color:#FF26D0">Lost Discs</h1>
<p style="color:#ffffff">
Below are listed the negative discs we know about and every disc's differences from the positive ones.</p>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">Disc 0</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">
Disc 0 is a version of the game with only a logo screen and one "room".
<br>
There is no music in the game. The only sound are the player character's footsteps (That are also found on the surface game in the positive discs)<br>
There is no pause menu.
<br>

The main menu displays a still logo on the pause screen background from the positive discs. Below is text that says "Press Start" and another line of text that says "&#169; Garalina 1996"<br>
After pressing start a room will load. This room seems to be the exact same as the first room from the level "Even Care" from the positive discs.<br>
The room's textures have a chequered pattern with pink an blue colors. This room seems to have been made very early in development to test the engine of the game. 
<br><br><br>
The disc was first found by Colon. It was given to him as a Birthday gift in 1996. The person who gave him the gift is unknown<br>
It was later found by Franky. Then given to the disc searcher. How Franky got a hold of the disc is unknown as Colon threw away the disc before finding about it's purpose.

<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">Disc -1</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">Disc -1 (Negative one) contains a plus disc with recolored/retuxtered rooms. It also contains several other diffrences.<br>
<img src="cold1.gif" alt="Screen Cap 2" align="center"> <img src="cold2.gif" alt="Screen Cap 3" align="center"><br>
The disc seems to have no catchable creatures (Pets) and the "Pets" button in the title screen has been replaced with "Discs"<br>
What the "Discs menu" contains is unknown at the moment of writing.
<br><br><br>
There is little information about the journey of the disc itself. It was found by the disc searcher and she is the only one who has it.<br>
Colon speculated that Disc -1 wasn't important in the timeline so almost no research was done on the disc.<br>
We can only currently trust the disc searcher's social media posts.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">Disc -2</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">Disc -2 (Negative two) is a variation of a positive disc. Little is known about this disc as only one person played it and only for a limited time.<br>
The only thing we can say about Disc -2 is that the hidden game grass section found in the positive discs (Also known by "Newmaker Plane") has been made a desert.<br>
<img src="sand1.gif" alt="Screen Cap 4" align="center"><br>
<br><br>
The disc was discovered by a person we won't say the name of and it was played for only 15 minutes and 29 seconds.<br>
A screenshot of the disc with the disc searcher playing it was discovered but we have no other evidence that the disc searcher has played Disc -2.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="color:#FF26D0">Disc -5</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff">Disc -5 (Negative five) contains private information. The only thing we can say right now is that the disc does not contain a game.</p>
